            The Mound of the Hostages is a passage tomb that is the oldest visible monument on the Hill of Tara.
            <br /><br />
            Rath of the Synods is a burial ground that was badly mutilated at the end of the 19th century during a misguided search for the Ark of the Covenant.
            <br /><br />
            Lia FÃ¡il is a phallic-shaped white granite stone that probably stood at the entrance to the passage tomb.

            Newgrange is a passage tomb consisting of a large circular mound with stone passages and chambers.
            <br /><br />
            The mound is surrounded by stones at the base including an intricate entrance stone.

            <br /><br />
            Loughcrew is a megalithic cemetery that spans several hill-tops.
            <br /><br />
            The tombs were put in the landscape with an eye on astronomy. There is an alignment with the sun on the shortest or longest day of the year.
