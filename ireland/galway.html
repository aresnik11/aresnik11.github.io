                <br />
                Enjoy the beautiful arches and dome of the Galway Cathedral.
                <br /><br />
                Inside the cathedral is even more beautiful with its elegant stained glass windows.
                <br /><br />
                There is a lovely riverside path from the Galway Cathedral to the Spanish Arch.

                Check out the Spanish Arch!
                <br /><br />
                Ships passed through the Spanish Arch carrying goods from Spain to unload in the city.
                <br /><br />
                Water no longer flows through the arch, but the arch sits next to a fast flowing river.

                <br />
                Walk down the streets of Galway and discover the shops and pubs it has to offer.
                <br /><br />
                Galway is a small city and easily explored by foot. You can get from the Spanish Arch to Galway Cathedral and anywhere else in a matter of minutes!
                <br /><br />
                Galway is a great place to get a Claddagh ring. The traditional Irish ring represents love, loyalty and friendship through the heart, crown and hands, respectively.
                <br /><br />
                The Aran Islands are only a short ferry ride from Galway and it is a trip that I highly recommend!

                <br />
                Take a trip to see one of Ireland's top destinations: the Cliffs of Moher.
                <br /><br />
                Located in the Burren region in County Clare, the Cliffs of Moher are just a short trip from Galway.
                <br /><br />
                The highest point of the cliffs is 214m and on a clear day you can see the Aran Islands and Galway, among other places.
                <br /><br />
                The Cliffs of Moher have also been featured in the sixth Harry Potter film.
