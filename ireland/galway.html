        <h2>Galway Cathedral</h2>
        <p>
            Enjoy the beautiful arches and dome of the Galway Cathedral.
            <br /><br />
            Inside the cathedral is even more beautiful with its elegant stained glass windows.
            <br /><br />
            There is a lovely riverside path from the Galway Cathedral to the Spanish Arch.
        </p>

        <h2>Spanish Arch</h2>
        <p>
            Check out the Spanish Arch!
            <br /><br />
            Ships passed through the Spanish Arch carrying goods from Spain to unload in the city.
            <br /><br />
            Water no longer flows through the arch, but the arch sits next to a fast flowing river.

        <img src="./images/galwaycity.jpg" id="vert" alt="Galway City Centre"/>
        <h2>City Centre</h2>
        <p>
            Walk down the streets of Galway and discover the shops and pubs it has to offer.
            <br /><br />
            Galway is a small city and easily explored by foot. You can get from the Spanish Arch to Galway Cathedral and anywhere else in a matter of minutes!
            <br /><br />
            Galway is a great place to get a Claddagh ring. The traditional Irish ring represents love, loyalty and friendship through the heart, crown and hands, respectively.
            <br /><br />
            The Aran Islands are only a short ferry ride from Galway and it is a trip that I highly recommend!

        <h2>The Cliffs of Moher</h2>
        <p>
            Take a trip to see one of Ireland's top destinations: the Cliffs of Moher.
            <br /><br />
            Located in the Burren region in County Clare, the Cliffs of Moher are just a short trip from Galway.
            <br /><br />
            The highest point of the cliffs is 214m and on a clear day you can see the Aran Islands and Galway, among other places.
            <br /><br />
            The Cliffs of Moher have also been featured in the sixth Harry Potter film.
