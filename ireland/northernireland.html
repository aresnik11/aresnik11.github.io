        <h2>Black Taxi Tour</h2>
        <p>
            Take a black taxi tour to learn about the history of Belfast. On the tour you drive around and stop at various historical sites.
            <br /><br />
            One stop is the Belfast Peace Wall that separates Irish nationalists and unionists. Irish nationalists tend to be Catholics and identify as Irish, while unionists tend to be Protestants and identify as British.
            <br /><br />
            Add your name to the peace wall and you might even find the names of some celebrities who have also signed the wall.

        <p>
            Take a trip to the north tip of Northern Ireland and walk across the Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge.
            <br /><br />
            The walk is an adventurous one as you are crossing a thin bridge over a cliff. If you have a fear of heights you might want to sit this one out.
            <br /><br />
            The bridge connects Carrick-a-Rede island to the mainland.

        <p>
            While up in the north, also stop by the Giant's Causeway.

            According to legend, the Giant's Causeway was built by a giant. However, it was actually the result of a volcanic eruption.
