        <h2>Rent a Bike</h2>
        <p>
            Although Inishmore is the largest of the three Aran Islands, you can easily explore the entire island via bike.
            <br /><br />
            Bike rentals are easy and cheap at Burke's Bicycle Hire. Burke can give you directions on how to get anywhere on the island.
            <br /><br />
            Biking across Inishmore is a great way to really see all that the island has to offer.
            <br /><br />
            Make sure you stop to take in the views along the ride!

        <h2>Dun Aonghasa</h2>
        <p>
            Bike across the island to Dun Aonghasa, an old fort that sits on the edge of a cliff that is 60m high.
            <br /><br />
            The fort does not have any rails or barriers so you can go right up to the edge of the cliff. It can be pretty scary on a windy day so be careful!
            <br /><br />
            The lack of rails allows you to sit on the edge of the cliff and dangle your feet off the edge.
            <br /><br />
            Dun Aonghasa has spectacular views and is a highlight of the island.
            <br /><br />
            The fort also has an interesting history that can be learned about at the visitor center.
